			<p>O<small>NCE</small>, high above a pasture, where a sheep and a lamb were grazing, an eagle was circling and gazing hungrily down upon the lamb. And as he was about to descend and seize his prey, another eagle appeared and hovered above the sheep and her young with the same hungry intent. Then the two rivals began to fight filling the sky with their fierce cries.</p>
			<p>The sheep looked up and was much astonished. She turned to the lamb and said,</p>
			<p>“How strange, my child, that these two noble birds should attack one another. Is not the vast sky large enough for both of them? Pray, my little one, pray in your heart that God may make peace between your winged brothers.”</p>
			<p>And the lamb prayed in his heart.</p>
