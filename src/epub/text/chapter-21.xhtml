			<p>A <small>FISH</small> said to another fish, “Above this sea of ours there is another sea, with creatures swimming in it⁠—and they live there even as we live here.”</p>
			<p>The fish replied, “Pure fancy! Pure fancy! When you know that everything that leaves our sea by even an inch, and stays out of it, dies. What proof have you of other lives in other seas?”</p>
