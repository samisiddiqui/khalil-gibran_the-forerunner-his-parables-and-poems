			<h2><a id="OUT_OF_MY_DEEPER_HEART" name="OUT_OF_MY_DEEPER_HEART"/>OUT OF MY DEEPER HEART</h2>
			<p>O<small>UT</small> of my deeper heart a bird rose and flew skyward.</p>
			<p>Higher and higher did it rise, yet larger and larger did it grow.</p>
			<p>At first it was but like a swallow, then a lark, then an eagle, then as vast as a spring cloud, and then it filled the starry heavens.</p>
			<p>Out of my heart a bird flew skyward. And it waxed larger as it flew. Yet it left not my heart.</p>
			<p>O my faith, my untamed knowledge, how shall I fly to your height and see with you manâ€™s larger self pencilled upon the sky?</p>
			<p>How shall I turn this sea within me into mist, and move with you in space immeasurable?</p>
			<p>How can a prisoner within the temple behold its golden domes?</p>
			<p>How shall the heart of a fruit be stretched to envelop the fruit also?</p>
			<p>O my faith, I am in chains behind these bars of silver and ebony, and I cannot fly with you.</p>
			<p>Yet out of my heart you rise skyward, and it is my heart that holds you, and I shall be content.</p>
