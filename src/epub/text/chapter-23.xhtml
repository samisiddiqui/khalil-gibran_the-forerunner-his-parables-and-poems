						<span class="i0">Wait, wait yet awhile, my eager friend.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">I shall yield but too soon this wasted thing,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Whose agony overwrought and useless<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Exhausts your patience.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">I would not have your honest hunger<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Wait upon these moments:<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">But this chain, though made of a breath,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Is hard to break.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And the will to die,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Stronger than all things strong,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Is stayed by a will to live<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Feebler than all things feeble.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Forgive me comrade; I tarry too long.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">It is memory that holds my spirit;<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">A procession of distant days,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">A vision of youth spent in a dream,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">A face that bids my eyelids not to sleep,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">A voice that lingers in my ears,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">A hand that touches my hand.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Forgive me that you have waited too long.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">It is over now, and all is faded:⁠—<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">The face, the voice, the hand and the mist<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">that brought them hither.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">The knot is untied.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">The cord is cleaved.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And that which is neither food nor drink is withdrawn.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Approach, my hungry comrade;<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">The board is made ready,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And the fare, frugal and spare,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Is given with love.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Come, and dig your beak here, into the left side,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And tear out of its cage this smaller bird,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Whose wings can beat no more:<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">I would have it soar with you into the sky.<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">Come now, my friend, I am your host tonight,<br/></span>
						<span class="i0">And you my welcome guest.<br/></span>
